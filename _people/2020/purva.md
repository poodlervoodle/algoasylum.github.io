I am a final year engineering student from Pune
I am interested in all things that can be coded and I am exploring machine learning and web development.
Decision Trees currently in-tree-gue me and I hope to do wonderful things with them. I have worked a little with Django(not the movie) and am now figuring out things I can do with React(I probably am console-ing a bug right now)
In my "no gadgets" time one will probably find me painting.
You can connect with me through my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/purva-bhalekar-03432918b/) and I would love to know what you've been working on as well!
